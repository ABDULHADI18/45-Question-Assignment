// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

const magicianNames = ['Harry Porter', 'David Copperfield', 'Ron Weasley'];

function show_magicians(magician: string[]): void
{
    for(const magician of magicianNames) {
console.log(magician);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
    const Greatmagicians: string[] = magicians.map(magician =>  magician);
    return Greatmagicians;
}

const GreatmagiciansNames:string[] =  make_great(magicianNames);

console.log("Original Magicians:");

show_magicians(magicianNames);

console.log("\nGreat Magician:");

show_magicians(GreatmagiciansNames);
