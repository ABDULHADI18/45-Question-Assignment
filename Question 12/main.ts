// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ['Ali','Kashif','Basim','Zain'];

let message =`Hey ${names[0]} how are you?`;

let message1 =`Hey ${names[1]} how are you?`;

let message2 =`Hey ${names[2]} how are you?`;

let message3 =`Hey ${names[3]} how are you?`;

console.log(message);

console.log(message1);

console.log(message2);

console.log(message3);
